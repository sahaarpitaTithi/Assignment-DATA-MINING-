# Assignment-DATA-MINING-

Q-1
Download the Iris dataset from the link here. Load the dataset into python using
appropriate library function. Then perform the following visualization using appropriate
labels of figures, sub-figures and axes:
i. Create box plot of each column in a single figure.
ii. Create pairwise scatter plot of each column. Colour the plots according to the
species.
iii. Create histogram of each column.

Q-2
On the dataset of the previous question (the iris data) perform the describe (library
function provided by pandas) function. Now write your own describe function called
my describe, which will take a data frame as input summarize it.


Q-3
Randomly generate a 4 × 4 numpy array of integers. Now create your own Min-Max
normalization function to perform on the array, first by considering each column representation data and second by considering each row representing data.

Q-4
Randomly generate a 4 × 4 numpy array of integers. Now create your own Z-score
normalization function to perform on the array, first by considering each column representation data and second by considering each row representing data.

Q-5
Load the breast cancer dataset provided by sklearn datasets and perform the following operations.
(a) Classify the dataset using KNN algorithm. Use appropriate library function for the
same.

Q-6
Use the following code to generate a dataset. Perform KMeans, agglomerative hierarchical
clustering algorithm on the data.
